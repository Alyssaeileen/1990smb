            OMG this game changed my life. I found it at a vintage store downtown. And Ive been playing non stop on my old nintendo thing. I am addicted to this game. All day I sit on the couch playing this game and get fat on cheetos. This game helped me take my mind off of my hedgehog's strategic accident.

THIS IS THE WORST!!!!! MY GRANDMA JUST ATE MY FAVORITE SUPER MARIO BROTHERS GAME. I GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND EVERYTHING, I LOVED PLAYING THIS GAME IT REALLY FRIED MY POTATOES, TOASTED MY BUNS AS THE PEOPLE SAY THESE DAYS. THE GRAPHICS WERENâ€™T ALWAYS THE BEST BUT IT WAS MY LAST MEMORY OF MY DEAD BROTHER WHO DIED THE CHRISTMAS I  GOT IT. but anyways aside from that whole spiel I would definitely recommend this game to others who are looking for a fun nostalgic game to play. Personally I find playing this game most enjoyable sitting by silently sobbing to myself sitting on the window sill looking out at the falling snow reminiscing on the day my brother lost his life. ANYWAYS 10/10 LOVED PLAYING THIS GAME GOT ME THROUGH MY FIRST THREE DIVORCES.

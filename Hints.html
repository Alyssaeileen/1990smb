Tips and Tricks


When you hit the flagpole, the timer in the upper right stops. If that number ends in 1, 3, or 6, you'll get the corresponding number of fireworks
<br>
<br>
<br>
First, get to World 3-1, find a pair of koopa troopas descending stairs. Ignore the first one. When the second one is still on the stairs, jump on it to put it into shell-mode, then stand one step below where the shell lies. Now jump on the shell. If you time it right, you'll automatically bounce off the shell over and over, so you get lots of points and 1-UPs
<br>
<br>
<br>
When you get back to the Player 1 or 2 screen after Game Over, hold the A button and hit Start. You'll then be taken back to the beginning of the world you died in. So if you die in World 3-3, you'll be taken back to World 3-1
<br>
<br>
<br>
Get to world 3-1, and become Super Mario. At the end of the level, by the staircase before the end flag, you will see two turtles coming down the stairs. Jumping over the first one and then jumping on the second one should cause it to hit the star and bounce back. From here, jump on it and keep yourself off the ground for unlimited 1-ups.\
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you collect all the coins in the third level of any world — for example, World 1-3 — you'll get a bonus 1-Up mushroom in the first level of the next world — for example, World 2-1. The 1-Up mushroom is located in an invisible block you have to hit.
<br>
<br>
<br>
At the end of World 3-1, there's a staircase that leads to the flagpole. Two Koopas come down the stairs. Jump over the first one, but then when the second one comes down, jump on the Koopa so he bounces against the stair. If you jump again and time it just right, you can jump on him multiple times, leading to multiple lives. If you get more than 128, your game will be over the next time you lose a life.
